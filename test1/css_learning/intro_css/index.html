<h1 >Hello World</h1>
<p>
    How would you get it to a satisfying conclusion? He hasn't been offered a pro contract (which was the goal of the manga) just a promise to be used intermittently with the adult side. Also, the big build up with the ongoing side plot with him and hana that's been ongoing since the beginning goes to waste if he can't go to Spain. If I recall there was hints of aoi possibly aiming for Spain himself with various parraels with fukada and conversations with him. Unless there's a spin off manga about aoi pro career on the horizon it all seems a bit sudden.

<h2>Paragraph 2</h2>
<p>
    My ideal ending is some semblance of conclusion to the tournament, and then having Aoi and Hana figure out their relationship. Then maybe a timeskip (not unlike the one in Haikyuu), we see Aoi playing in Europe, and manga ends with him getting called up for the World Cup and reuniting with teammates/rivals.

<h3>Paragraph 3</h3>
<p>
    I hope he gets an offer from La Masia and breakout there, and the epilogue is an older Ashito finally returning to Esperion to play under Fukuda again.

    Edit: doesnâ€™t this mean Ashito and Hana can have their happy ending since she seems set on going to spain?
